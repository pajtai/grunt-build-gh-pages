# grunt-build-gh-pages

> Grunt plugin to take a build from dist on your current branch and put it into another branch, e.g. gh-pages, without merging. Ideal for when builds should be stored in orphan branches.

## Note

Tested on a Mac. Seems to currently have issues on Windows.

## Working Example

If you'd like to play around with a working example, fork [exploratory-javascript-tests](https://github.com/pajtai/exploratory-javascript-tests), and run `npm install && grunt build`, then look at the `gh-pages` branch.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-build-gh-pages --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-build-gh-pages');
```

## Assumptions

* You are using version of Node (0.8.19+) and NPM (1.1.6+) that support peer dependencies.
* This task is run after you have run the build task (or as the end part of your build task)
  * The full build must be in the distribution directory at the beginning of this task.
* A separate branch that has just the builds exists
* You want to auto push to that separate branch when you run this task!

## The "build_gh_pages" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `build_gh_pages` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  build_gh_pages: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

* `dist`: The directory the build is placed in. This directory should be gitignored in your current branch and the build branch.
  * Default: "dist" 
* `build_branch`: The name of the branch the build should be commited to. This branch should exist. Ideally it should be an orphan branch.
  * Default: "gh-pages"   
* `pull`: Whether you want to the a `git pull --rebase` on the build branch before modifying it. Use this if mutliple people can build to the repo.
  * Default: `true`
* `exclude`: An array of other directories besides `node_modules` you wish to exclude. These directories should be in the `.gitignore` of both branches.
  * Default: `[]`
* `cname`: The contents of the CNAME file that defines [the custom domain for your gihub pages](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages).
This allows you to have multiple orphan branches with multiple CNAMES.
  * Default: `undefined`

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used to do something with whatever. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result would be `Testing, 1 2 3.`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  build_gh_pages: {
    gh_pages: {
      // Leave empty if you just want to run the defaults
    },
    production: {
      options: {
        build_branch: "prod",
        dist: "prodOptimized",
        pull: false
      }
    }
  },
})
```
