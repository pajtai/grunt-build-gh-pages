# grunt-build-gh-pages

> Grunt plugin to take a build from dist on your current branch and put it into another branch, e.g. gh-pages, without merging. Ideal for when builds should be stored in orphan branches.

## Working Example

If you'd like to play around with a working example, fork [exploratory-javascript-tests](https://github.com/pajtai/exploratory-javascript-tests), and run `npm install && grunt build`, then look at the `gh-pages` branch.

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

1. Install grunt-build-gh-pages
	```shell
	npm install grunt-build-gh-pages --save-dev
	```
	
	One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:
	
2. Add an option to Gruntfile

	(from usuage example)
	
	```js
	grunt.initConfig({
	  buildGhPages: {
	    ghPages: {
	      options: {
	        build_branch: "gh-pages",
	        dist: "dist",
	        exclude: ['node_modules', '.tmp', '.sass-cache', 'app/bower_components'],
	      }
	    }
	  },
	})
	```

3. Register task to Gruntfile
	```js
	grunt.registerTask('deploy', [
	  'buildGhPages:ghPages',
	]);
	```
	
	if you constructed an environment using Yeoman, add `'build'` task to avoid removing bower components.
	```js
	grunt.registerTask('deploy', [
	  'build',
	  'buildGhPages',
	]);
	```

4. Add a files in exclude option to .gitignore to your production branch
	```shell
	node_modules
	.tmp
	.sass-cache
	app/bower_components]
	```

5. Commit your changes before deploying

6. Deploy and ENJOY!
	```shell
	$ grunt deploy
	```

## Assumptions

* You are using version of Node (0.8.19+) and NPM (1.1.6+) that support peer dependencies.
* This task is run after you have run the build task (or as the end part of your build task)
  * The full build must be in the distribution directory at the beginning of this task.
* A separate `--orphan` branch that has just the builds exists
* You want to auto push to that separate branch when you run this task!

## The "buildGhPages" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `buildGhPages` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  buildGhPages: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

* `dist`: The directory the build is placed in. This directory should be gitignored in your current branch and the build branch.
  * Default: "dist"
* `build_branch`: The name of the branch the build should be commited to. This branch should exist. Ideally it should be an orphan branch.
  * Default: "gh-pages"
* `pull`: Whether you want to the a `git pull --rebase` on the build branch before modifying it. Use this if mutliple people can build to the repo.
  * Default: true
* `exclude`: An array of other directories besides `node_modules` you wish to exclude. These directories should be in the `.gitignore` of both branches, or at least one. For example if you have a submodule called `api`. `api` should be in the `.gitignore` of the build branch, and the exclude array should be `['./api/**']`.
* `copy_hidden`: If this value is truthy. Hidden files will be copied from the root dist directory to the final build directory. Hidden files in subfolders of dist are automatically copied.
  * Default: false
* `cname` : add CNAME support to github pages
  * Default: fasle

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used to do something with whatever. So if the `testing` file has the content `Testing` and the `123` file had the content `1 2 3`, the generated result would be `Testing, 1 2 3.`

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  buildGhPages: {
    ghPages: {
      // Leave empty if you just want to run the defaults
    },
    production: {
      options: {
        build_branch: "prod",
        dist: "prodOptimized",
        pull: false
      }
    }
  },
})
```
